## WHAT IS IT?

DieRoller is a die rolling utility for Dungeons and Dragons players, other
gamers, and anyone who might want to roll dice. It lets you roll 1 to 8
dice, which can be 4,6,8,10,12,or 20-sided. It also knows how to roll
Percentile Dice (a single die with a value between 1 and 100).

This version of DieRoller is mostly a port of my older PocketC version. I
ported it to Quartus for speed, and along the way added the following
features:

- Percentile dice
- The program now saves your # of dice/# of sides settings between invocations
- An about box, help screen, and menu have been added
- Multi-bit application icons have been added
- Since the program no longer requires the PocketC runtime, it's quite a 
  bit smaller than the old version.

Future versions of DieRoller may add other features.

## How Do I Use It?

The user interface is pretty simple. See the Help screen if you need more
pointers.
